      <p>Hi! We are Nick, Robert, James, Christine, Andrew, and Toshi! We are students at Brown Unversity 
        who made this project as our final for CSCI0320: Introduction to Software Engineering. We are a group 
        who loves word games and wanted to make something that us and our fellow word game lovers could enjoy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>This is a spinoff of one of the word games that have been trending lately. However, we wanted our users
        to be more connected. Thus, we also included a feature where you can see the results of all people who
        played the puzzle for the day! We also added a profile page where you can see a more detailed analysis 
        of your gameplay statistics. We hope you enjoy!
